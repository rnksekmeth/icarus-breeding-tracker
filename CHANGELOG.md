## v0.27b – Pentest XSS audit & browser security
**2026-04-14**

Active penetration testing with crafted JSON payloads confirmed 5 critical and 8 high-severity XSS vulnerabilities that survived v0.27, plus two browser security gaps identified from an OWASP/HTML5 security review. All fixed.

### Security — Confirmed exploitable XSS (CRITICAL)
- **Parent names in renderHerd** — `p1`/`p2` fields rendered as raw HTML in the herd table; `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` as a parent name executed on herd tab load
- **Parent names in viewAnimal panel** — same field injected unescaped into the animal view panel
- **Suggestion animal names** — `r.sugM.name` and `r.sugF.name` in Goals tab recommendations unescaped
- **Upgrade rec animal names** — `better.name` and `reserve.name` in upgrade rows unescaped
- **Goal bloodline/phenotype labels** — `r.goal.bl` and `r.goal.ph` from user `goalsMap` injected raw into `goalLabel` HTML

### Security — HIGH
- **blBadge in viewAnimal** — `a.bl` unescaped in the bloodline badge chip
- **phDisp fallback** — `a.ph` raw value used as fallback when `phenoDisplay()` returned empty; affected both renderHerd and viewAnimal
- **Warning strings** — `r.sugM.bl` bloodline name in pair warnings unescaped
- **Advice panel** — `r.currentName`, `r.goal.bl`, `r.goal.ph`, `bl` in upgrade/temp/equal advice items unescaped

### Security — Browser
- **Reverse tabnabbing** — added `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to all 5 `target="_blank"` links; without this an opened page can navigate the original tab via `window.opener`
- **Clickjacking** — added `frame-ancestors 'none'` to the CSP meta tag; `frame-src` only controls what *this page* embeds — `frame-ancestors` is what prevents *this page* from being embedded in a malicious iframe

---

## v0.27 – Security hardening
**2026-04-14**

Combines v0.26c and v0.26d (neither was pushed). Full security audit conducted including active penetration testing with crafted JSON payloads.

### Security — XSS
- **`$h()` function** — HTML-encodes all user data before innerHTML insertion; applied to 51 call sites across all animal text fields (name, nickname, bloodline, phenotype, species, parents, notes)
- **`probRow` label and color** — phenotype/bloodline labels in Breeding Odds panel HTML-encoded; color values validated against strict regex before style injection
- **`buildStatsRow` tooltip** — stat tooltips HTML-encoded
- **`showConfirm` / `showUndoToast`** — msg parameters HTML-encoded before innerHTML
- **Log renderer** — `_linkifyLogMsg` HTML-encodes raw message before linkification

### Security — onclick injection
- **`$esc()` backslash bypass fixed** — critical: backslashes are now escaped before HTML encoding, preventing `\\` + `\'` from breaking out of JS single-quoted string context; verified safe against crafted payloads including `\'); alert(1); //`
- **Filter buttons** — use `$esc()` for filter type and value; display label uses `$h()`
- **Pair assignment** — `$esc()` used for species, sex and animal name
- **Optimizer conflict badge** — species name in title attribute now uses `$h()`

### Security — input validation
- **`applyData` hardened** — all fields type-checked and whitelisted; strings sanitised via `_sanitizeStr()` with max-length caps; stat values clamped to 0–10 integers; booleans coerced; prototype pollution prevented; existing save data preserved through migration system
- **JSON.parse guarded** — file load paths have explicit try/catch with user-facing error toast on parse failure; pool tile dataset parse also guarded
- **Wiki URLs validated** — must start with `https://` before injection into href

### Security — infrastructure
- **Content Security Policy** — meta tag blocks external connections, frames, objects and fonts; images restricted to self/data/blob
- **Pentest report** — active testing with crafted JSON payloads confirmed no remaining code execution vectors

---

## v0.26b – Numeric sort, GR data migration & odds panel toggle
**2026-04-14**

### Security
- **Content Security Policy** — added CSP meta tag blocking all external connections, frames, objects and fonts; restricts image sources to self/data/blob only
- **probRow XSS** — phenotype and bloodline labels in the Breeding Odds panel are now HTML-encoded; inline color values validated against a strict regex before injection into style attributes
- **Tooltip XSS** — stat labels in the entry form's data-tip attributes now go through `$h()`
- **showConfirm / showUndoToast XSS** — msg parameters HTML-encoded before innerHTML insertion
- **onclick injection** — filter buttons and pair assignment buttons now use `$esc()` instead of a partial single-quote-only escape, closing backslash and attribute breakout vectors
- **Wiki URL injection** — cfg.wiki URLs validated to start with `https://` before being placed in href; falls back to `#` if invalid
- **applyData hardened** — all fields from loaded JSON are now type-checked, string fields sanitised via `_sanitizeStr()` (max length enforced), booleans coerced, numbers validated, prototype pollution prevented by rejecting non-plain-object input; existing save data is preserved through the same migration system
- **JSON.parse guarded** — file load paths now have explicit try/catch around JSON.parse with a user-facing error toast on parse failure; pool-tile dataset parse also guarded
- **Log renderer** — `_linkifyLogMsg` HTML-encodes the full message before linkification (carried forward from v0.26c)

---

## v0.26c – XSS security fix
**2026-04-14**

### Security
- **XSS vulnerability fixed** — animal text fields (name, nickname, bloodline, phenotype, species, parents, notes) are now HTML-encoded via a new `$h()` function before being inserted into innerHTML; previously a crafted JSON file could inject and execute arbitrary HTML/JS
- **`$esc` hardened** — the onclick attribute escaping function now also HTML-encodes, preventing attribute breakout attacks
- **Log renderer secured** — `_linkifyLogMsg` now HTML-encodes the raw log message before linkification, so animal names containing tags can no longer inject markup into the log

---

## v0.26b – Numeric sort, GR data migration & odds panel toggle
**2026-04-14**

### My Herd
- **Numeric name sort** — Name column now sorts by species ID numerically (DR9 → DR10 → DR100) instead of lexicographically

### Breeding Pairs
- **Breeding Odds collapsible** — the panel header is now clickable to collapse/expand; collapsed state persists while the panel is open
- **Removed theory warning** — "THEORY ONLY" notice removed from the Breeding Odds panel

### Data
- **v6 migration** — existing save data with `Swamp Raptor` animals, pairs and goals is automatically renamed to `Geothermal Raptor` on first load; runs once and saves immediately

---

## v0.26 – Favicon, level field, breed log & GR rename
**2026-04-14**

### UI
- **Favicon** — added raptor footprint tab icon (dark background, orange claw); no more generic browser globe icon

### Animals
- **Level field** — optional level input (1–50) on the Add/Edit Animal form; displayed as a badge in the Animal View panel
- **Mutation rate estimate** — Unstable animals with a level set show an estimated phenotype/bloodline mutation rate in the viewer (scales from ~20% at level 1 to ~65% at level 50)

### Log
- **Breed outcomes** — adding a bred animal now logs the bloodline, phenotype and stat total: `🥚 [name] bred — [bl] / [ph] / [X] stats`; a new "Bred" filter button in the log makes these easy to find
- Tamed animals now log as `Added [name] (tamed)` to distinguish from bred entries

### Breeding Pairs
- **Removed DR/GR cross-breeding** — `CROSS_BREEDS` emptied and cross-breed banner removed from the Pairs tab; mechanic was bugged due to DR and GR sharing skill trees
- **Share My Herd colours** — card colours now match the app's dark green theme (`--bg`, `--card`, `--acc`, `--bdr`) instead of the old blue palette

### Species
- **Swamp Raptor renamed to Geothermal Raptor** — abbreviation updated from SR to GR across all tabs, filters, species data, icons and wiki links

---

## v0.25b – Pair pool cross-breed fix
**2026-04-06**

### Breeding Pairs
- **Cross-breed pool fix** — animals already slotted in any pair (including another species' pairs) no longer appear as available in the pool; previously only the current species' pairs were checked, so e.g. a SR in an SR slot would still show as available under DR

---

## v0.25 – Pair DnD fix & optimizer stat priority
**2026-04-06**

### Breeding Pairs
- **Drag and drop fixed** — pair slot tiles in the Pairs tab now correctly accept drops; event listeners were previously only attached during Goals rendering, meaning DnD was silently non-functional in the Pairs tab
- **Drag highlight fixed** — slot highlight no longer flickers when the cursor moves over a child element inside the slot (fixes the classic `dragleave`/`relatedTarget` bug)
- **Occupied slot confirmation** — dropping an animal onto an already-filled slot now shows a confirmation dialog ("Set [name] to Reserve and replace with [name]?") instead of silently overwriting; displaced animal is set to Reserve status if confirmed

### Optimizer
- **Stat goal takes priority over bloodline diversity** — the bloodline diversity preference (spreading pairs across different bloodlines) no longer overrides a significantly better animal; diversity is now only applied among candidates with a non-negative score, so a negatively-weighted animal (e.g. Wild bloodline, base phenotype) can no longer be favored over a high-stat positive animal purely for variety

---

## v0.24 – Side panel, tile polish & goal charts
**2026-04-05**

### Animal Viewer
- **Side panel** — the viewer is now a persistent fixed panel on the right side of the screen instead of a centered modal; slides in when any animal name, tile, or log entry is clicked; no longer blocks the rest of the UI
- **Badge chips** — bloodline and phenotype shown as colored pill badges at the top of the panel (using `BLOODLINE_COLOR` and phenotype rarity color) alongside sex and generation chips
- **Radar fixed** — chart now renders correctly in the panel (previously drawn before the canvas existed in the DOM)
- **Clickable parents** — parent names in the viewer link directly to that parent's viewer if the parent is in the herd

### Breeding Pairs
- **Bloodline badge on tiles** — the bloodline label is now a SAVAGE-style colored pill badge using `BLOODLINE_COLOR`
- **Phenotype border stripe** — each tile has a colored top stripe indicating phenotype rarity (base: grey, uncommon: green, rare: blue, legendary: orange)
- **Short tile ID** — tiles show only the species ID (e.g. `DR02`) instead of the full generated name; full name visible on hover
- **Slot tiles clickable** — tiles in breeding pair slots now open the viewer (previously only pool tiles did)
- **Removed pair score** — the combined `S:XX` score label is removed from pair rows; individual stat totals on tiles are sufficient
- **Upgrade wording fixed** — the upgrade panel now shows "no upgrade" (muted style) when the best free animal is weaker than the current paired animal, instead of incorrectly labeling it "optimal"
- **Tile name colors** — male/female tile name colors slightly brightened (`#6aa4b8` / `#c07890`)

### Edit Animal
- **Form radar** — the stat entry form now shows a live radar chart that updates as stat values are entered or changed
- **Radar label clipping fixed** — all radar charts (viewer, edit form) now use dynamic `maxR` scaled to canvas size; viewer canvas enlarged to 200×178, form canvas to 190×168

### Goals
- **Clickable animals** — all animals in Breeding Suggestions are now clickable links that open the side panel viewer
- **Stat goal is species max** — the stats target threshold is now always `getMaxTotal(sp)` (theoretical max for 6 non-BO stats); user-editable control removed
- **Reserve target ± buttons** — the reserve count text input is replaced by `−` and `+` buttons
- **Phenotype sighting radar** — a single P0–P7 radar chart replaces the individual per-row stat radars; each axis is a phenotype tier, value is sqrt-scaled total sightings (tamed + bred), axis labels show the count; dots are colored by rarity
- **Bloodline sightings colored** — bloodline names are now colored using `BLOODLINE_COLOR` to match the rest of the app

### Sighting Counts
- **Counts include dead animals** — phenotype and bloodline sighting counts are now derived directly from the `animals` array (no status filter) rather than the incremental `phenoStats`/`blStats` counters, which could miss animals added before tracking was introduced; only Discarded animals are excluded

### Log & My Herd
- **Log: clickable animals** — animal names in log entries are hyperlinked and open the viewer
- **My Herd: clickable parents** — parent names in the herd table are clickable if the parent exists in the herd

### Docs
- **README updated** — all major sections rewritten to reflect v0.24 features; screenshots added for New Animal, My Herd, Breeding Pairs, Goals, Edit Animal, and Animal Viewer

---

## v0.23 – Icarus design system
**2026-04-05**

- **New visual design** — full palette overhaul to match the in-game aesthetic: dark olive-charcoal backgrounds, olive-green section headers, amber stat values; replaces the old blue-navy scheme
- **Pairs: drag-and-drop tile slots** — pair assignment now uses chamfered tile slots (top-left + bottom-right corners cut, matching Icarus item slot style); animals are shown as draggable tiles and can be dragged from the pool into male/female slots, between slots, or back to the pool; the underlying assignment logic is unchanged
- **Pairs: animal pool** — each species card now shows a pool of available (unassigned) animals below the pair slots as draggable tiles; clicking a pool tile opens the animal viewer
- **Herd: full-row click** — clicking anywhere on an animal's herd row (except buttons and dropdowns) opens the animal viewer panel, replacing the name-only clickable area
- **View panel: radar chart** — the animal view panel now shows an amber polygon radar chart of stat values; axis labels only; the breed-out stat vertex is highlighted in red
- **View panel: stat layout** — stats now shown as two-column rows (label | value) that never truncate, replacing the 7-column grid
- **View panel: sex colors** — male/female indicators now use the muted blue/mauve palette matching the tile system
- **Remove button** — tile ✕ button uses vivid `#e06060` red (matching the SAVAGE bloodline badge)

---

## v0.22 – Animal viewer & smart pairing
**2026-04-05**

- **Animal viewer panel** — clicking any animal name in the herd table opens a read-only view panel showing full details, stats, current pair assignment, and optimizer suggestion for that animal; includes quick-action buttons to change status, assign to/remove from a pair slot, or jump to the edit form
- **Auto-status on pair assignment** — adding an animal to a pair slot (manually or via the optimizer) automatically sets their status to Breed; removing or replacing them reverts status to Undecided, but only if the status was Breed (prevents overriding Reserve/Station set deliberately)
- **Optimizer: pair conflict warnings** — if the optimizer proposes moving an animal that is already in a different pair slot, a ⚠ warning now appears in the modal row indicating which pair they will be moved from
- **Smarter cull suggestions** — optimizer now suggests culling when: a desired trait is covered in a pair slot and the animal is well below stat goal (70% threshold); an animal is outclassed by a paired same-sex/species animal and has no unique positive traits; near-max-stat animals are protected from this redundancy cull

---

## v0.21d – Smarter optimizer suggestions
**2026-04-05**

- **Suggestion: trait already covered** — when an animal has a desired trait but below-goal stats, the optimizer now checks how many pair slots already carry that trait; if 2 or more pair animals already share it, the suggestion becomes Cull (the trait is well-represented and a weaker below-goal animal with no unique value should not occupy a station slot)

---

## v0.21c – Optimizer & stability fixes
**2026-04-05**

- **Critical fix: saveAndRefresh broken** — a prior patch accidentally replaced the bodies of `saveAndRefresh` and `saveAndRefreshFull` with recursive self-calls; every save threw a silent stack overflow, so the UI never re-rendered after any operation (data was saved correctly, but the herd/pairs view only updated on the next tab switch)
- **Fix cross-breed native constraint** — Phase 3 now tries both sexes when enforcing the native-animal rule; previously if no native of the preferred sex was available it silently gave up, leaving both pair slots filled with cross-species animals
- **Fix optimizer Apply button feedback** — button visual update (✓ Applied, disabled) now happens before `saveAndRefresh()` so re-renders cannot clobber it; individual Apply buttons also show a toast confirmation
- **Fix optimizer auto-close** — switched from unreliable DOM button query to an explicit counter; modal now reliably closes once every individual Apply button has been used
- **Done button in optimizer modal** — new footer button closes the modal while keeping any partial changes already applied, for when you only want to action some suggestions
- **Undo dead marking** — clicking 🪦 on an animal no longer shows a confirm dialog; a 5-second Undo toast appears instead so accidental culls can be reversed immediately
- **Pre-push checklist** — added version-check and legacy-archive steps to CONTRIBUTING.md; legacy zips now stored in `E:\Claude\icarusBreedingTrackerLegacy\`

---

## v0.21 – Optimizer improvements

- **Cross-breed native constraint** — the optimizer now guarantees at least one native-species animal per pair slot; previously it could fill all DR or SR slots with cross-species animals if they scored higher, breaking native bloodline continuity
- **Individual Apply buttons** — each proposed pair row and each status-suggestion row in the Optimize modal now has its own Apply button; clicking it applies that single change without closing the modal, then marks the button as ✓ Applied and disables it
- **Cross-breed offspring disclaimer** — corrected to "Offspring will be DR or SR" (was incorrectly showing only the host species)
- **Fix optimizer modal crash** — suggestion rows used `si` (index) without declaring it in the `.map()` callback, causing a ReferenceError that prevented the modal from rendering; fixed to `.map((s, si) => ...`
- **Fix version label not updating** — `APP_VERSION` was not bumped during the v0.21 patch; now correctly shows v0.21
- **Fix optimizer Apply button feedback** — button visual update (`✓ Applied`, disabled) now happens before `saveAndRefresh()` so a re-render cannot clobber it; individual Apply buttons also now show a toast confirmation
- **Auto-close on completion** — the optimizer modal now closes automatically once every individual Apply button has been used; Apply Pairs Only and Apply All also close the modal
- **Version naming** — `APP_VERSION` and commit titles now consistently match the CHANGELOG section heading

---

## v0.20r1b – Fix app header showing wrong version
**2026-04-05**

- Version label in the app header was not bumped during the v0.20 / v0.20r1 release, leaving it showing "v0.19"
- Version string now driven by a single `APP_VERSION` constant in the JS — no more two places to update

---

## v0.20r1 – Code revision
**2026-04-05**

- Extracted repeated form-reset logic into `resetFormUI()` — previously copy-pasted across three functions; also fixes `cancelEdit` not clearing the nickname field
- Extracted stat-input reading into `getFormStats()`
- Extracted `save(); renderHerd(); renderPairs()` chains (appeared 10 times) into `saveAndRefresh()` / `saveAndRefreshFull()`
- Promoted inline `optLabel` and `mkUpg` closures to top-level named functions (`pairOptionLabel`, `renderPairUpgradeRow`)
- Renamed `phW_` (underscore-suffix-to-avoid-shadowing) to `phItemScore` / `phScore`
- Added JSDoc comments to all major functions
- Added CSS utility classes (`.text-dim`, `.text-sm`, `.text-xs`, etc.) for the most-repeated inline styles
- No behaviour changes

---

## v0.20 – Favorites, nicknames & pair optimizer
**2026-04-05**

- **⭐ Favorites** — star any animal from the My Herd table; favorited animals are never suggested for culling by the optimizer but can still be moved to reserve or taken out of rotation
- **Nicknames** — set an optional display alias per animal in the Add/Edit Animal form; the original generated name (e.g. DR05) is always preserved for internal matching and shown dimly next to the nickname in the herd table and pair dropdowns
- **⚡ Optimize Pairs** — new button in My Herd and Breeding Pairs headers (plus a per-species ⚡ button on each pair card); runs a greedy algorithm that scores all active animals against your goals and bloodline/phenotype priorities, proposes the best M×F pair assignments for each slot, maintains bloodline diversity across multiple pairs, and suggests status changes (Reserve / Store / Cull) for remaining animals based on their traits and stats relative to your stat goal
- Fixed a bug where `isBred` was computed but not stored on the animal object, causing the "Goals achieved" check in the Goals tab to never trigger

---

## v0.19 – Activity log & smart suggestions
**2026-04-05**

- New tab: 📋 Log (between Lineage and Settings) — full activity history with type filters (Added/Edited/Status/Pair/Deleted/Suggestion) and text search
- Log banner: fixed bar at page bottom always shows the latest log entry with a "View log" link
- Configurable max entries (default 100); older entries trimmed automatically; full clear option
- Logged events: animals added or edited, status changes, pair slot changes, animal deletions, advice panel actions
- Goals: new "✓ Goals achieved" section — flags when a bred animal already matches a species goal and suggests updating the goal or starting a new breeding direction
- Goals: new "↑ Reserve upgrades available" section — detects when an unassigned animal has the same desired trait as a reserve animal but higher stats, and suggests a swap
- Goals: new "⚡ Diversity" warning — if all active pairs of a species share the same bloodline, suggests varying genetics to maintain separate breeding lines

---

## v0.18e – Parent & pair dropdown fixes
**2026-04-05**

- New Animal / Edit Animal: Dead/Culled and On Station animals now appear in the parent datalist — shown with 🪦/🛸 icons so they are visually distinct from active animals
- Pairs: removed redundant [DR]/[SR] species tag from cross-breed animal names in pair dropdowns (moved from v0.18d)

---

## v0.18d – Pair dropdown cleanup
**2026-04-05**

- Pairs: removed redundant [DR]/[SR] species tag from cross-breed animal names in pair dropdowns — the species code is already part of the animal name

---

## v0.18c – Custom animal names
**2026-04-05**

- New Animal + Edit Animal: optional "Custom name" field below the generated name — leave blank to use the auto-generated name, or type any override
- Duplicate name check fires as you type; save is blocked if the name already belongs to another animal
- When editing an animal whose name was previously customised, the custom name field is pre-filled automatically

---

## v0.18b – Advice panel actions
**2026-04-05**

- Breeding advice panel (New Animal tab): replaced the "🗑 Remove" button with three status actions — 🔶 Reserve, 🪦 Cull, ❓ Undecided
- The displaced animal is never deleted; choosing an action sets its status and refreshes the panel immediately

---

## v0.18 – Persistent layout
**2026-04-05**

- Collapsed/expanded state of species cards in Pairs and Goals tabs now persists across reloads
- Collapsed/expanded state of individual sections within Goals cards (Phenotype Priority, Bloodline Priority, Suggestions, etc.) also persists
- Stored as arrays in the save file alongside other layout state (cardWidths, speciesOrder); no data migration needed

---

## v0.17b – Masonry layout fix
**2026-04-05**

- Fix cards overflowing into each other in Goals and Pairs grids
- Root cause: `getBoundingClientRect()` was returning the 1px grid-track height instead of the card's content height, so every card got a near-zero row span and its content visually overlapped the card below
- Fix: set `align-self: start` on each grid item before measuring — forces the item to size to its content regardless of the allocated track height
- Establish patch letter versioning convention: bug fixes use a letter suffix (v0.17b), new features get the next integer

---

## v0.17 – Species Goals & Smart Layout
**2026-04-05**

- Goals: per-pair goals replaced with species-level goals (add/remove freely, not tied to pair count) — pairs tab badges now show "✓ Goal N" matches against species goals
- Goals: Pair recommendations in Breeding Suggestions now show one suggestion per species goal, not per pair slot
- Goals: Negative star priorities added (−1/−2/−3, shown in red) for both bloodlines and phenotypes — animals with negative-starred traits show ⚠ warning badges in Pairs tab
- Suggestions: new "⚠ Negative-trait animals worth considering as Temp breeders" section — flags animals with bad traits but ≥20% better stats than best clean animal of same sex; warns if both suggested animals share the same negative trait (increased inheritance risk)
- Suggestions: stats target input added (default 60) — priority animals below target are flagged
- Defaults: Unstable bloodline initialises to ★★ priority for all new species; stats target defaults to 60
- Layout: masonry grid layout for both Pairs and Goals — shorter cards fill the vertical space under taller neighbours rather than always defaulting to the leftmost column; re-runs on window resize
- Data: version bumped to 5 with migration (old per-pair goals promoted to species goals)

---

## v0.16 – Chips & Dynamic Height
**2026-04-05**

- Pairs & Goals: collapsed cards now render as compact inline chips above the grid instead of occupying a full grid column — multiple chips sit side-by-side
- Goals: added card-level ▼ Hide / ▶ Show button (matching Pairs behavior); collapsed state is per-species, in-memory
- Both grids now use `align-items: start` so each card only takes as much vertical space as its actual content — collapsing a section immediately shrinks the card
- Chips are draggable for reordering, same as full cards

---

## v0.15 – Goals Sections & Width Toggle
**2026-04-05**

- Goals: each section (Breed-Out Stat, Pair Goals, Phenotype Priority, Bloodline Priority, Phenotype Sightings, Bloodline Sightings, Breeding Suggestions) now has a clickable ▼/▶ header to collapse/expand it independently per species
- Pairs: Narrow/Wide toggle button added to the pairs card header (was Goals-only); changes are now reflected in both tabs as before
- Renamed "1-wide / 2-wide" toggle labels to "Narrow / Wide" across both tabs

---

## v0.14 – New Animal Polish
**2026-04-05**

- New Animal: parent datalist now shows one entry per animal (spId · name format) — no more duplicate or partial entries from prior field state
- New Animal: ⚠ THEORY ONLY disclaimer moved to the bottom of the probability panel
- New Animal: 🗑 Clear button added to reset the form without navigating away; pair-assign and prob panels are also dismissed; button is hidden/inert when editing an existing animal

---

## v0.13 – Ordering & Suggestions
**2026-04-05**

- Breeding Pairs + Goals: drag-and-drop species card reordering (shared order, drag by ⠿ handle); order persists to save file
- Breeding Pairs: collapsed species cards now sort to the bottom of the grid automatically
- Breeding Pairs + Goals: ▣ 2-wide / ◧ 1-wide toggle per species card; persists to save file
- Goals: Breeding Suggestions panel per species — shows priority animals not in pairs (by bloodline/phenotype stars), reserve candidates (desired trait but lower stats), and per-pair recommendations; Unstable treated as a breeding priority in scoring
- Goals + New Animal: reserve target per species — set desired number of reserve animals; current vs target shown in New Animal tab when species is selected; Unstable flagged as a breeding priority
- New Animal: parent fields changed to neutral "Parent 1 / Parent 2" — either field accepts either parent; save now validates that two known parents must be opposite sex

---

## v0.12 – Sightings, Pairs & Filters
**2026-04-05**

- Share Your Herd: phenotype now colored by rarity (grey/green/blue/orange); bloodline now colored with a fixed per-bloodline palette (same system used throughout the app)
- Goals: editing an animal now correctly adjusts bloodline and phenotype sighting counts — changing Alpha → Savage decrements Alpha and increments Savage; isBred flag changes (adding/removing parents) are also handled
- Pairs: each pair row now has a red × delete button — removes that specific pair regardless of position, and automatically sets both animals in the pair to 🔶 Reserve
- My Herd: phenotype filter pills now show positional labels only (Base, P1, P2…) so cross-species filtering works correctly — selecting P1 shows all P1 animals regardless of species; "Dune Raptor (base)" and "Normal (base)" both appear as "Base"

---

## v0.11 – Quality of Life
**2026-04-05**

- After saving a new animal, a "Place in Breeding Pair" panel appears below the form
- App scores all compatible pair slots and highlights the best suggestion (empty slots prioritised, then by score improvement)

- If the chosen slot already has an occupant, the panel shows their name and score with three options: keep their status unchanged, move them to Reserve, or mark as Discard
- Placing an animal auto-updates their status from ❓/Keep to 🐣 Breed
- Panel is dismissed when the user starts a new entry or clicks Skip

## v0.5 – Data Migration
**2026-04-05**

- Add `DATA_VERSION` constant — bump this whenever a schema change requires migration
- `loadedDataVersion` captured on load so migrations know where to start
- `migrateMemory()` now runs versioned steps in order (v1→v2→v3→...→current)
- localStorage fallback correctly treated as v1 (pre-version-field data)
- Future schema changes need only a single `if (loadedDataVersion < N)` block
- Data automatically re-saved after migration so the file is always up to date
